Easly source code is defined in the [Easly-Language](https://github.com/dlebansais/Easly-Language/) assembly. A controller, created and initialized with any of the Easly objects, can display the source code content in a .NET WPF application, allowing modification of the source code.

# Architecture

The controller is made of several layers, each layer adding features to the other layer it's built on.

## Read-Only

This layer only provides read access to the source code, but introduces the core classes of the controller:

1. Indexes

An index is similar to a C++ iterator, but is fixed. It represents a child in a parent. There are five type of indexes:
+ Placeholder, a child node. This is the most straightforward index. This index has two specialized forms, one for block list replication patterns and another for block list source identifiers. 
+ Optional, a child node that is optionally assigned (throught the `IOptionalReference<>` interface).
+ List, a list of child nodes of the same type.
+ BlockList, a list of blocks of child nodes, all of the same type, with replication support (see the `IBlockList<>` interface). This index comes in two forms: an index for the first item in a block, and an index for all subsequent items in that block. Within the BlockList index, there are two variants:
  * One for a new block. This specifies the first item in the node list of the block
  * One for an existing block, to specify further items. 

Note that the read-only layer provides indexes that only allow reading source code. The next layer (Writeable, see below) introduces insertion indexes, describing children not yet inserted.

During examination of the node tree, indexes are created for new blocks. When this step is completed, and blocks initialized, they are replaced with indexes in existing blocks. 

2. States

These classes represent all data associated to a particular node in the source code tree. For the read-only layer, there isn't much to store, but subsequent layers add more info, like the existence of breakpoints and other temporary data. Blocks in block list also have a specific state class. And finally there are two dedicated state classes for block list replication patterns and another for block list source identifiers. 

3. Inners

They are the glue between states and indexes. There are as many types of inners as there are types of indexes, and given a state and inner one can obtain an index to the corresponding child.

4. Browse Context

Contexts (for short) contains data accumulated when the source code tree is parsed. For the read-only layer, this is simply a collection of indexes for each state and their children, but subsequent layers may contain more.

5. Views

One or more views can be attached to a controller. For the read-only layer, they don't do much, but when clients of the controller are able to modify the node tree, each modification will trigger a notification for all views. Then, each view can react differently to the modification and maintain a separate internal state.
 
## Writeable

The writeable layer, as the name suggests, adds features to modify the source code. The following operations can be performed:

+ Replacing a node with another.
+ Changing the assigned status of an optional node.
+ Inserting a node in a collection (list or block list).
+ Removing a node from a collection (list or block list).
+ Moving a node up or down in a collection (list or block list). Note that, for block lists, a node can only be moved within a block.
+ Performing operations specific to block lists:
  * Inserting a new block (removing a block is automatic when then last node in the block is removed).
  * Splitting and joining blocks.
  * Changing the replication type.
  * Moving blocks around in the block list.
+ Expanding or reducing a node (see below).
+ Modifying values in a node, for exemple discrete values.

This layer also adds insertion indexes. They represent the index of a node to add/replace/insert rather than an existing child node. An insertion index is created by a client of the controller, and upon return of the requested operation (say, insert), the corresponding browsing index is provided. This returned index can be used for further operations like changing the node again. 

### Expanding nodes

When working with the source code it can be practical to hide values in the code that are just set to the default, but that means it can hard to find them when one wants to change them. Node expansion is provided for this purpose:

+ An expanded node gets all optional nodes assigned, to a default value if there isn't one already.
+ All lists that can be empty, such as arguments of a call to a method, have a default empty node added. With this feature, the user can move the cursor to this empty piece and start editing it.

The opposite operation, reduce, will unassign all optional nodes that only contains a default value, and clear lists that only contains a single default child.

Since multiple expand operations can be performed, it may be difficult to track them over time. A single "canonicalize" operation is therefore provided: it will look for any expanded node and will reduce it to its canonical, non-default parts.

### Undo/Redo

The writeable layers supports undoing and redoing operations, by calling the `Undo` and `Redo` methods. The list of operations that can be undone or redone is also available.

## Frame

The Frame layer introduces a first level of display by creating a grid and assigning all individual components of the source code to a cell. There is no visual display, but with the cell system you can have line and column numbers.
Cells are per-view so it is possible to have a different display, with different line numbers for example, using different view.

To create and assign cells, a controller view uses a template, one per node (but specific to the view). A template in turn contains a hierarchy of frames dedicated to positioning components of the node, and from frames you can obtain cells. All templates are grouped in a template set, declared when the view is created, and that cannot be changed.

A typical use for template sets is for example having a set that is verbose and another that is compact. The verbose template set will have more decoration elements and keywords, and therefore more cells. The compact template set could hide values that are set to the default, thus having less cells than the verbose one.

### Cell views

They are grouped in the following categories:

1. Cell collections

These are cells containing other cells (obviously), for example to display a list. If a list contains 3 items and each of them takes just one cell, the cell collection will span 3 cells, aligned along a line or a column (there is a cell collection for lines and another for columns).

2. Single cell views

+ The empty cell, used for components that are not to be displayed, such as unassigned optional nodes.
+ The container cell, with an associated state view. This cell is a leaf in the cell tree, and indicates further calculation of line, column and other positions in the grid should use a new cell tree, created from the state and the associated template.
+ The block cell view, specifically containing an embedded cell view for a block of a block list.
+ A simple visible cell (decoration keyword and symbols...)
+ A simple focusable cell (decoration keywords that can have the focus, insertion points...)
+ A simple focusable cell associated to content (enums, boolean values in the source code such as abstract/not abstract...)
+ A simple focusable cell associated to text content (identifiers and other names...)

### Frames

Frames are constant objects that can be reused for multiple source codes, and describe how a node of a given type is organized in cells. At initialization time and after each change in the source code, the controller view calls methods of frames to update the cell tree.

Frames are unique to their host template (more on them later), and each template begins with a root frame. Frame are also organized in categories:

1. Panel frames

These frames are just collections of other frames. They will create cell collections, then let nested frames provide nested cells. Like cells, panel frames come in two forms: the horizontal panel frame that will create lines of cells, and the vertical panel frame that will create columns.

2. Frames for collections

These are frames for lists, and for block lists. Both come in horizontal and vertical form. For block lists, each block has a dedicated block template that depends on the type of child nodes. For example, several parts of the source code have block lists of assertions. There is therefore a template for blocks of assertions that describe each block. In turn, blocks can themselves be aligned horizontally or vertically and the frame for that is called a collection placeholder frame.

3. Frame for single elements

+ Placehoder frame, for a child node.
+ Optional frame, for an optional child node.
+ Value frame, for a component that is a value in the node (such as a boolean).
+ Text value frame, for a component that is a string value in the node. There are also two specialized frames, one for single characters and another for numbers (as it can have a special exponent display).
+ Discrete frame. This one is special in that it delegates the task of creating cells to a sub frame, chosen depending on a value of the ndoe. For example, an enum.
+ Keyword and insertion point frames. They create cells that can have the focus, but are not associated to content in the source, they are only for decoration and edition purpose. 
+ static frame that can't even have the focus, but generate visible frames. For example: parenthesis, brackets, dots...

### Templates

As mentioned, a template is a constant object that given a node or block in the source, of a type that is specific to the template, will generate a tree of cells starting with the root frame of the template.

There are two sorts of templates, one for node themselves and one for blocks. For nodes, the template is specific to the node type (ex: assertion, body, class). For blocks, the template is specific to the block of nodes of a given type (ex: blocks of assertions, blocks of bodies).

### Template sets

Finally, template sets group templates together, with a list for nodes and another for blocks. A template set must be provided at the creation of a view, and cannot be changed afterward. Note that template sets must be complete: they must provide a template for all possible types of nodes and all possible types of blocks.
 
## Focus

The focus layer introduces several features.

### Frame visibility.

Starting with the focus layer, the content of a node can be only partially visible, for example if some information is redundant, such as a boolean or an enum having the default value. Several types of visibility are introduced:
 
+ Complex expressions: a complex expression is surrounded with parenthesis. The template associated to the expression must have the `IsComplex` property set to true for the parenthesis to appear. This property ensures that when an expression contains nested expressions, there is no ambiguity in the evaluation order. For example, the binary operation expression is complex: one writes `clone of X`, but not `clone of X+Y`. It's `clone of (X+Y)` instead. Since `clone of` is also complex, one writes `(clone of X)+Y`, not `clone of X +Y`.
+ Empty collections: if a collection is empty, surrounding decoration like keywords and symbols can be hidden as well.
+ Default value: if a property has the default value, this value can be hidden.
+ Replication visibility: when a block is replicated, it can interesting to see the replication pattern. Likewise, when the block is not replicated, the pattern can remain hidden.
+ Not the first item: in a `if`, `else if`, ... `else` sequence, the first `else` only appears at the second item. A special visibility is introduced to hide the `else` part for the first item.
+ Text match: some string values have a special meaning, like `All` for export specifications. It is possible to hide a string if the content matches a pattern.
+ Optional visibility: used to hide or show symbols around an optional node. When unassigned, these symbols are hidden.

### Frame selector

It is sometimes useful to display a node differently depending on the context. For example, an identifier could be displayed with a different color depending if it's used in an expression or a type. Similarly, a body can be displayed slightly differently in overloads, getters or setters.

To support a generic mechanism, the focus layer introduces selectors. In a frame, selectors can be assigned to some node type. Then, in the template for that type, several selectable versions can be declared. The version used will be the one that matches the selector. For example, the template for an effective body has three version, one used in an overload, and two others for getters and setters respectively.

### Focus

This is the feature giving the layer its name. Each view has a single cell with the focus, a caret for string, and an insertion/overwrite mode. Special care need to be taken when the node corresponding to the cell with the focus is removed or replaced. In this case, the code attempt to stay on the same cell if possible, and will move the focus to the nearest, or most preferred (see below) cell. 

### Preferred frame

In a template, it might be desirable to put the focus on a specific part of the node rather than the first focusable cell. The new focus is set on this frame, if possible.

### User-enforced visibility

To let user modify parts of the code that are invisible, for example because they have a default value, a special flag is introduced. When this flag is set, the node with the focus is completely visible, even for frames where the visibility settings would hide them. All other nodes are restored to their normal state, so that there is only one node expanded like this at any time.

Then, when the flag is turned off, normal visibility is restored, and if for example a value was changed to not be the default, it remains visible.

### Operations at the focus

Having the focus set on some part of the code enable the possibility of special operations:

+ Inserting a new item when the focus is inside a list or block list, or on an insertion frame.
+ Removing the current item if the focus is inside a list or block list.
+ Moving the current item up or down in the list.
+ Splitting the block with the focus in two.
+ Merging the block with the focus and the previous block.
+ Cycling through variations of bodies and features.
+ Splitting an identifier in two parts, separated by a dot, in a qualified name.
+ Simplifying a node.
+ Changing the replication status of the current block.
+ Moving the current block.

## Layout

This layer is dedicated to measuring, arranging and drawing cell views.
These operations are executed as follow.

1. Measure

The cell tree is measured, starting from the root and recursively. Each cell is measured, either by measuring and concatenating nested cells, or by measuring the size that takes the frame that created the cell for a leaf of the tree.

Some cells are stretched, i.e. one of their width or height is known but not both. For example, in a line some cells like text cells can have a fixed size, and others like parenthesis or bracket symbols have a stretched height. A streched dimension is represented by a NaN value and is resolved during the draw phase.

2. Arrange

Once cells have been measured (stretched cells are supposed to fit later), they are arranged and positioned on a canva.

3. Draw

When the client wants to display cells, it can just call the Draw() method, and it be called back with as many draw operations as necessary to complete the request, each with a location and size as well as an atomic draw operation to perform. For example, draw text, or a geometry associated to a symbol.

4. Print

The Print method can be used to create a snapshot of the source, in simple text or RTF formats. Geometric symbols like parenthesis or brackets are reproduced with special unicode characters.

### Separators

They are not registered as cells but instead handled during the draw phase. The measure phase simply adds empty space between cells as necessary.

Each line and column has an associated frame with an associated separator. As long as the separator isn't specified in a child frame, it is used for all cell children, so eventually all cells end up with the reference to a parent cell that was the last one with a specified separator. When the draw phase is executed, it is this parent cell that must take care of drawing the separator.
